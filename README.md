  - etc
- AI to help defining:
  - When to water your plants
  - When you need to open your green house
  - When you need to add certain types of "inputs" to your soil 
  - etc.
- And last but not least, your garden with vector drawing
  - graphical display of the different types of sensors
  - graphical display of the different types of plants

## Technical requirements
- Postgresql 14 / sqlite3 (to be defined)
- Grafana
